# JavaScript
This is the codebase for my JavaScript article series designed to prepare you for the 
certification exam administered by the International JavaScript Institute.

The code examples are kept very simple and basic so that you can focus on the core idea.

Here is a link to the [Introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsKAGbldpaQ-Rmh6n99OLXfzKIYrhmOtnL3Qb_11Mr0/edit?usp=sharing)

You can find the written tutorial [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZhZ5dejOGhwRPLqGPSTrPdys6ZgJyc9PSRtklGKCgg/edit?usp=sharing)

In the written tutorial, we metioned concepts like dynamically and weakly typed, 
object-oriented, prototype based, imperative and declarative programming. These concepts
won't be fully grasped without looking at the examples in this codebase.
